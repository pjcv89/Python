## Anaconda

Anaconda is a scientific Python installation shipping with essentially all needed packages. Install it according to the instructions on their homepage. You can use any Anaconda Python version. An Anaconda Python installation is completely separate from any existing system wide or user space Python installation, so Anaconda can be tested without the fear of breaking an existing installation.
